For my final major project, I was giving an open self-determined brief that encouraged me to use the design skills I have obtained during my time at University. By using my design skills, creative techniques and independent learning I hoped to achieve a design concept that was a solution to a problem.
<br>
I refined the brief by aiming to create an innovative project that could help people organise their lives. As well as organisation I wanted this project to be fun and engaging to the target audience.
