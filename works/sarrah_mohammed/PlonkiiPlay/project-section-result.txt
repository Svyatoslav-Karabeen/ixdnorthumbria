Using RFID technology I created a prototype that first asks the child to match the pattern to the animal. The story I had written was to help Zac the Zebra find the watering hole by asking his friends. However, to get to the next part of the story, the child would have to place the correct animal on the platform. This gives an aspect of ‘magic’ to the product, allowing the child to think they are bringing the story to life.

PlonkiiPlay also has longevity within the product. As the child gets older, they can unlock further story editions and expand on their reading capability as they grow older.
