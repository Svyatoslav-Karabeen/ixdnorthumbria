Well Extra is a 24-hour Self-Serve Pharmacy Kiosk that works alongside with an additional app to provide instant access to repeat prescription and over-the-counter medications. Users can order their prescription through the application then order for collection at any time. Other than providing customer prescriptions the atm also offers over the counter prescriptions 24hrs. For young adult and middle-age customers, since they have higher technology skills than elderly group, they are able to additionally use the app alongside with the Kiosk to well manage their repeat prescriptions. For elderly group, they don’t have to use the app to order their repeat prescription. The automatic sms service will send notification to user’s mobile phone to remind them when they’re running out of prescriptions medicines and they can confirm to refill via replying sms. After that, the service will notify when the prescription is ready and the user can collect it at the preferred 24h kiosk anytime they want.
