The process of using Hunt is very simple. once the application is downloaded the user is taken through a sign up process to find out specific details about you like favourite brands/shops, your location etc. Hunt is customised to suit each customer so they can follow brands and shops they prefer to keep updated on the latest drops which targets the younger audience who want to stay up to date. Finding an item is made easy with thumbnails of each category for the user to quickly search for a product. Once an order has been placed one of our delivery drivers will be notified and send on route to pick up order. In this time you can track your item until delivery. The service will help users who don't have time to buy an item from town for a party later, manage their time better.
