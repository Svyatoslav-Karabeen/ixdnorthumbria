Your task will be to create and design an on-line magazine using
the Wordpress platform. You will be required to create content for
a major feature on a subject relating to one aspect of your chosen
creative sector. You should adopt the attitude of an investigative
journalist to really bring out the best in your story. Additional
content can be aggregated from other existing websites but you
should ensure that any authors are properly credited and that
your Magazine is aimed at a specific target market i.e you should
first identify who would be likely to read your Magazine and then
investigate and apply marketing strategies and tools that you could
use to encourage user engagement and customer loyalty.
