Overall I feel like I achieved my design goals and ended up with a practical interface design that could benefit the tesla user. I feel like the module idea really worked out for me as I was able to really focus on efficiency and ease of use. One of my aims was to modernise interface design so I used a very dynamic flat design with a simple yet attractive colour scheme.
