For my project I investigated the technology of virtual reality (VR). The prototype that I produced combined VR technology with my own personal interest in footwear and the customisation of shoes. I styled my project as a service by Nike that would allow users to customise and personalise existing models of Nike shoes in a virtual reality environment, with a tangible element to enhance the user experience. The concept however, could be used to to customise many different products from a vast array of brand.
