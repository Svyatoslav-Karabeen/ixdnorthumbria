The scenario that was set for us we have solved as best a solution as possible. We introduced a series of features that meant a business owner didnâ€™t have to spend a large amount of time on managing the frustrating part of their business such as managing their staff and keeping track of which employee is paid and how much they have been paid.

As the brief also mentioned that the app could be used as both an employee and employer. Due to this, we interviewed and did user testing for both employees and employers, we identified key user needs and problems with the current platform that Sage offer.
