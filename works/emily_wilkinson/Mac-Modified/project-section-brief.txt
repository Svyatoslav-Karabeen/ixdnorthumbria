Because this was my final project, it was a completely open brief, with the aim of engaging with a new design problem and communicating a solution in the form of a prototype. <br>This project was originally driven from a person problem I encountered whilst shopping for makeup. I noticed a lot of customers testing lipstick directly onto their face and this made me raise a question of how unhygienic really are makeup testers?<br>After a lot of research I created a concept of an augmented reality makeup try on station which allows customers to see what the product would look like without actually having to try it on. After creating three initial concepts I asked looked back at the problem I was encountering and decided my solution was not strong enough. I decided I was focusing too much on promoting a hygienic shopping experience; it was portraying makeup testing as a negative thing. <br>After looking back on my retail research, one main problem stores encounter is because more and more people are shopping online, stores are losing custom. This is where I created my final concept, introducing an iPad application that allowed customers to view their augmented reality makeover, before receiving their real one.
<br>For my final prototype, I ended up merging the two services together to create one service ‘Mac Modified’, which included Mac Modified ‘Personal’, the virtual makeup try on station, and Mac Modified ‘Assistant’, the iPad application used by Mac makeup artists to modify customers virtual makeover.
