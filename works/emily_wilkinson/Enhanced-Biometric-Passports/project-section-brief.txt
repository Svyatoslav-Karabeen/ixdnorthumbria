The UK Government’s Digital Service (GDS) isresponsible for the Gov.uk website, GDS is partof the Cabinet Office, their job is the digitaltransformation of the government. Our brief was to create a new service, this could be based on a current need or a more fanciful, speculative future need.<br>To begin this project, we set out looking at other where the UK sat on a ‘government matrix’ in terms of how digitally advanced we are. After doing this research we came across Dubai’s future plans for airport fast tracking, this is where we were inspired to create our service ‘Enhanced Biometric Passports’.
