To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses must perceive the digital environment to be physically real. Immersion into virtual reality is a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment.

The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.

To achieve this I focused on three of the senses; sight, sound and touch by using panoramic 3D displays (visual), Surround sound acoustics (auditory) and haptics and force feedback (touch)<br> By using my knowledge of the motion tracking studio and fear cognition, and by correlating the two with little or no noticeable latency, I will be able to elaborate such associations.
