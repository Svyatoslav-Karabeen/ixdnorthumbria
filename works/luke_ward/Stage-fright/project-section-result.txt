CAVE systems are highly expensive and impractical and most companies offering virtual exposure therapy use VR headsets. I plan to focus my experience around combining the two and establishing the practice of rehabilitation and therapy whether that be PTSD or a phobia and introducing it into an immersive environment.<br> There often is an avoidance behaviour that stems from the anxiety of the afflicted and due to cost and technology limitations, Virtual reality exposure therapy has not been widely available, to date.<br> I managed to bring the idea of a CAVE and exposure therapy to an accessible and identifiable level that a range of users can participate in and enjoy using.
