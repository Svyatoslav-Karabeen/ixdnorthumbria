In the end, I had created a real time coaching application for accuracy based team sports, to train precision creatively and track progress efficiently. The USP was a live target creation tool, linking to an immersive training area for players to physically smash the digital targets. A players performance would influence suggested target speed, size and type for future training sessions.
