<p>This was an open brief and we were free to create anything we wanted to. I decided to create an app based on a problem that happens quite frequently.</p>
<p>When food shopping, I always forget what items I still have at home as well as remembering when they go out of date.</p>
<p>The idea was to create an app which kept track of all this data and would be accessible on your phone.</p>
