<p>We started the brief by looking into different student incentives that were already out on the market. We came across hundreds of different student packages.</p>
<p>As a team we looked at the ones which stood out the most and analysed them in detail. </p>
<p>We decided on one thing which was that students like to spend money, this then grew into an idea of having a service which would offer students incentives when they spent money. We came up with ‘student perks by atom bank’.</p>
<p>This was a subscription service where students would sign up to receive exclusive discounts in certain business. Once they redeem their discount they would also receive ‘perk points’ on their student perks account. Users can save up ‘perk points’ and redeem for instant cash.</p>
