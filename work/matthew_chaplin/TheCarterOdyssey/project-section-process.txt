<p>The process began by moving the creation of my augmented reality museum companion. Taking the concept of this idea and moving it into the next advancement in technology; VR, was something that could work really well with the concept.</p>
<p>Speaking to the head curator of a large museum in Newcastle on the concept of a VR addition to a museum.</p>
<p>When prototyping the concept that I had brought on, I had initially created a concept on walking around the ancient Egyptian desert but when in practice and prototyping it was clear that the scope was incredibly large and had to be reeled in.</p>
<p>Moving it into the theme of an escape room helped the development massively due to the nature of a large number of interactions in the setting of an escape room. Then moving into Unity to create and prototype my series of interactions, to then create levels depending on certain types of interaction. As VR is a very solo experience, I planned to make puzzles based around working in a team while keeping the player immersed as possible.</p>
