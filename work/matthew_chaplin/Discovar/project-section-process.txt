<p>During the end of my 2nd year at Northumbria, I found a video online on a plugin for Unity called Vuforia. Following this, I looked into how I would be creating something interesting over the summer break from university. Over this time, I had visited The Great North Museum where I had spoken to several employees and a curator on the future of technology within the museum. They had mentioned at the time that they donâ€™t really have the funding for an expensive exhibit that involves current or a slightly more cutting edge piece of tech. When mentioning the technology of having an augmented reality companion or addition to a series of exhibits, the curator I had spoken to had really enjoyed the thought of a companion to feature alongside an exhibit. </p>
