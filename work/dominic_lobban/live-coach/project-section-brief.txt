<p>How has technology changed your chosen area of research and the people who work within it? You are required to predict where your chosen technology may be going, be able to suggest new and innovative ways that your technology could potentially be used, and design a prototype to demonstrate your concept. Prediction was a huge theme throughout this brief. The final prototype was allowed to be fictional, as long as it was well conceived and viable. I knew there, that I could push my chosen field of Sport as far as possible.</p>
<p>After exploring sport related installations, coaching applications and upcoming trends, I identified an issue with coaching team sports. Individual progress is tricky to track during group training sessions, resulting in a lack of progress and engagement for players. Current training methods were inefficient. Installations cost the time and money of many people at any one time. Applications went as far as team organisation with no consideration for control of a training space.</p>
