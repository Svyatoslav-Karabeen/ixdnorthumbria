<p>As the last opportunity to design something was entirely up to me, I chose the industry of skateboarding to study. I spoke to over 20 real skateboarders around NewcastleÂ throughout the course of the project. Up until this project, I had studied how to solve problems through my designs. What I quickly discovered was that skateboarders simply love every aspect. Yes they fall off and bruise and get angry, but that makes the feeling of landing a trick so much sweeter. </p>
<p>I had to create something to simply emphasise the beauty of skateboarding. I couldn't make it perfect weather to skate in every day, or provide friends to skate alongside users every day, or could I?</p>
