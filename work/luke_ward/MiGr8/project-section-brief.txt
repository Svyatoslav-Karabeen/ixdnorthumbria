<p>I was trying to gain an insight into the process of migrating to the UK and how people found it once they had been granted residency. I am looking at it from the angle of social culture and how easy and settling immigrants are made to feel when residing in the UK and I found that Integration in the community, being lonely, connecting, xenophobia, fear, problems with the right wing media, finding out information and at first learning the countries culture and etiquette are very common problems.</p>
