<p>Following a few iterations and user tests, the final form factor has been selected. It is a smart wristband because it is small enough to wear it all day long and is large enough to house required electronics and be noticeable to the user to act as a cue. Also, due to its simplicity, the device is relatively cheap that makes it affordable for a broad audience.</p>
<p>Next, the chosen form factor inspired me for another core feature - scannable RFID tags what tell the device about completing the routine. After having the cue, the second important thing in habit creating process is to track time performance of each action so the user can see the progress, which may be used in as a reward as well. So the usage of RFID-tags as checkpoints eliminates any additional user input or user efforts such as pressing a button on the device that makes the habit creation process more natural and unconscious.</p>
<p>Finally, to review all collected information, create new habits and set new goals and rewards, I designed the companion mobile app, which serves only as an input source for the smart wristband. The colourful and modern interfaces suppose to create the feeling of novelty while clear and minimalistic habit graphs should provide all the necessary information, so the user track his progress.</p>
