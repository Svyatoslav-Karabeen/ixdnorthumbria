<p>Initially I began considering a better way of creating habits. However, after brief contextual and competitor research, it became clear that building new habits is as important as ruining old, usually unhealthy habits such as procrastination.</p>
<p>To understand what universal solution can I offer to combine both these functions, I decided to find out the habit nature and how habits work from the scientific point of view. It appears that habit creates in the result of repeated behaviour in a consistent context and consist of three main components:
• Cue, a trigger that tells your brain which routine to use
• Routine, the physical, mental or emotional behaviour or action that follows the cue
• Reward, a positive stimulus that tells your brain that the routine works well</p>
<p>Next, I discovered why the most of the habit tracking and habit building mobile apps don’t last for long. The reason is quite simple: to trigger a routine that people want to develop, they use the device with the same set of audio/visual signals (notifications) that used by all other apps installed on a phone, so the brain doesn’t recognise the difference between a habit app notification that should serve as the cue, and notification from Instagram, Twitter, iMessage or any other app that people usually dismiss automatically. In other words, the smartphone doesn’t serve as a proper cue because it’s a universal tool with the same set of triggers used in an inconsistent environment.</p>
<p>After gathering these valuable insights, the solution was clear - a dedicated device that serves as a cue and can be recognised by the brain as a trigger.</p>
