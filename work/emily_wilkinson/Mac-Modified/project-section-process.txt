<p>As I began this project, my aim was to use Unity software and use the plugins for face tracking which are available. However, after experimenting, I realised usingthe plugins would limit me to how I could design the interface, which was my key focus. From this point I found another solution, which was to create video mockups of myself using the interface and trying on different looks. My final prototype for ‘Mac Modified Personal’ was created in After Effects.<br>The design process I went through to succeed in this project was to ensure I conducted thorough user research and testing throughout. This allowed me to define my users and create realistic user journeys in which my service would be used. View my design document to see the full process of my project.</p>
