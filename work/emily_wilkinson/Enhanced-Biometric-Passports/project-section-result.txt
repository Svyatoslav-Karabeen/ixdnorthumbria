<p>Throughout this project we undertook some challenging questions, such as, ‘could children use this service?’, ‘how would women wearing Niqabs use this service?’ and ‘is this service eligible for users with facial differences such as burns?’ Constantly asking ourselves questions throughout and putting ourselves in the users position is what made our project a success. </p>
