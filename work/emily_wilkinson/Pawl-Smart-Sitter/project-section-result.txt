<p>This is where I introduced Pawls smart sensors, the idea is for the owner to place sensors around their home in places their dog is not allowed, once the Pawl collar gets to close to these sensors, an alarm will trigger on the Pawl device to distract the dog from doing what it was about to do. A notification is then sent to the ownerâ€™s application on their phone while they chose what function for the device to do. <br>To mock up my prototype I decided to do an animation to make the whole product light hearted and fun. My final animation I created the illustrations and completed it in Adobe After Effects.</p>
