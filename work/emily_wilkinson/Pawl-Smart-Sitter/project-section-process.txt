<p>Initially I set out this brief looking at pet health devices and ways to keep your pet fit, after a lot of competitor research I realised that this is already a hugely covered topic in the product and app design world, I wanted to create something slightly different.<br>Therefore I began researching into pet training where I came across an interesting topic of what happens when you leave your dog home alone? This is where I came across devices such as PetCube and Cleverpet, however these current products on the market entertained the dog, but what was there to stop him from causing mischief?<br>This is where I came up with my concept, the smart dog sitter, Pawl. Pawl is an on wall device, which blows bubbles, sprays a calming diffuser, has a tog TV and throws treats. Each of these functions came from my primary research I undertook throughout this project.<br>The idea behind Pawl is dogs like to cause mischief if they know their owner is not watching, and from my research I found that they often repeat the same naughty thing each time, this could be sitting on the sofa they know they arenâ€™t allowed on or unraveling the toilet roll.</p>
