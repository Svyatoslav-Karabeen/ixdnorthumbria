<p>The brief for this project was to choose a form of technology and create a service, system or product that is on the cutting edge of the chosen technology. I had to research the technology and look into where the technology is currently at, and where it may be heading. To tackle the problem, I decided to divide the project into two halves across two semesters. During the first semester I worked on the conceptual side of the project and created a mock-up prototype that showcased how my idea could work in the real world. The second semester was spent refining my idea and creating a working version of the prototype that was fully functional.</p>
