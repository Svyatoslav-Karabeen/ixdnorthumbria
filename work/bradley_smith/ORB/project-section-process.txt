<p>To gain a better understanding of my users I decided to interview real people who have dementia as well as their families and friends. This allowed me to do an in depth research analysis as I got to research and test with real users.</p>
<p>After my research stage I then moved on to prototyping so that I could test and make important changes that were needed to make my project stand out from the competitors.</p>
