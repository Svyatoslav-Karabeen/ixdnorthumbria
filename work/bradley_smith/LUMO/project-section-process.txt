<p>We outlined our process through a project plan which allowed us to pinpoint the key areas that we needed to focus on, these were Refinement, Design, R&D and Marketing.</p>
<p>Once we had these areas outlines we then started to dive deeper and look into the skin and why it reacts the way it does. This was really interesting as it was something I had never looked into before and it allowed both of us to expand our knowledge.</p>
<p>After gathering our background research we then planned our visit to the hospital to gather the first-hand experience of dermatologists and nurses as they were experts in the field of skin.</p>
