<p>There was no set brief for this project as I took it as a continuation from the previous semester. In the previous semester I created Boost. In this project, I created a gym application, aimed towards beginners in the gym. The original project was a success, but I wanted to push it further and see where it could go. </p>
<p>For this semester, I refocused Boost and changed the perspective to imagine it as a business and a fitness community. Even though I refocused the business, I still wanted the end deliverable to be an application, but also feature accompanying documents/products that support the business such as a Business Model Canvas and merchandise.</p>
