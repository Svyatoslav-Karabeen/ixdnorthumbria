<p>Boost 2.0 (what I'm calling this version of Boost, to avoid confusion) is a total change from the 1st version. The downfall from the previous project was that it seemed to get lost with all of the other competitor gym applications on the market. By changing the focus to being a fitness community, it really allowed me to utilise social aspects, along with having to accommodate for all types of fitness. </p>
<p>To make sure my app was suited for my audience, I did a lot of user interviews and user testing. Through 1-to-1 interviews and online surveys I received quality data from the potential users, which helped fuel the content and the design for the app. </p>
<p>When designing the app, I took a lot of influence from my competitors. It wasn't necessarily the look of their apps, as it was more how these app's interactions worked. Interactions such as page transitions and icons that featured micro interactions were the things that really appealed to me. </p>
<p>From designing the application in Sketch, I transitioned over to Flinto to prototype. This allowed me to integrate all of the interactions which I took inspiration from. All in all, a very successful process.</p>
