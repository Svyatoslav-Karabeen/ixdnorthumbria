<p>The outcome of Boost 2.0 has been very successful. The app had a full re-design which looked really slick and modern. Although the app looked good, it functioned really well too. This was down to my 3 stages of user testing being successful. By creating a range of documents/products to support the brand, it really helped to bring the business together. This was the first time I’ve looked at a project with a more ‘business head’ and it opened my eyes to more than just creating an app. Boost 2.0 has taught me to analyse the ‘whole package’ and I’m really pleased with that.</p>
