<p>This project was an RSA Student Design Awards live brief. The brief had the heading of ′Wearing Intelligence 2.0′. The brief was to develop a design solution that utilises ′advanced textiles′ (fabrics that have been enhanced by new technologies) to improve wellbeing or the quality of people′s lives. </p>
<p>The brief asks us to explore the world of advanced and smart textiles, and to find an application where their use can offer a significant benefit to the user, or even society as a whole. How can textiles be used to keep us safer? Support our health and well-being? Help us communicate? Transport us faster? Reduce our environmental impact? Think how physical products could interact seamlessly with connected and digital worlds. </p>
