<p>We (Jack and Dominic) found that the sports industry was dominated by intrusive health trackers and expensive wearables for the wrist. We found that there had been little attempt at embedding wearable technology within sports clothing. Observing various sporting events indicated that injury and foul play were the two main things holding competitive sport back.</p>
<p>We considered a 'fairplay' jersey, that would glow with contact, for non-contact sports. We were concerned that this measurable would be too frequent and interrupt the play even more. We wanted something non intrusive, not distracting and beneficial. We turned our attention to injury, focusing on muscular cramp. Further specialist research showed us the specific factors and appropriate measurable to advise on muscular cramp within a pair of shorts. The shorts would glow in the local area of the muscle fatigue.</p>
<p>As a fictional concept, we needed to visualise how our shorts could be used, therefore detailed storyboards were created. We wanted to target both casual players and high end professionals.</p>
