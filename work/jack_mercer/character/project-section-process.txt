<p>When given the brief, I was very pleased that we were using the Wordpress platform as I have used it previously so felt very confident. With this being said, I still wanted to push myself and create a thoroughly engaging website with advanced features such as PHP coding, alongside the use of advanced plugins for Wordpress. </p>
<p>For the brief, I chose to create a website based on digital typography. By choosing to do a typography website, it would really test me to get the correct feel throughout through use of type and imagery. For the style, I chose to stick to a stripped back theme through and let the images deliver colour on the pages. Because of this, the brand was also based around grayscale colours. </p>
<p>When working on the Wordpress development, I really wanted to get in to the code and build each page myself. I coded the PHP page templates using a Bootstrap framework alongside PHP snippets to populate the content. One of the plugins used is Advanced Custom Fields which allowed me to create sections in the backend of Wordpress and then code in their snippets in to the PHP to show content on each page. </p>
