<p>I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and helped me further understand experiential design and how much it can contribute to a good product. Learning and using processing for the first time was fun and I think this area of the project went well for me. The live visuals were really responsive and engaging, which is exactly what the target audience would want. The game was also well balanced in terms of its challenge because it is being designed as an educational quiz you still need to ensure the player can still get the correct answer with not too much difficulty.</p>
