<p>The aim of this module was to create a prototype and a design document of your chosen technology which solved a problem. To find a problem I looked into some current technology trends to see which ones was getting mainstream. After coming across on-demand services, I wanted to find an area which this service could be applied to. Looking into the clothing industry there wasn't much services for same day delivery which I saw as an opportunity. After talking to other people and being in previous situations this type of delivery service would be useful is desperate situations.</p>
