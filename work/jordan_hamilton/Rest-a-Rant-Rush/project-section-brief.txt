<p>Investigate what is happening on the cutting edgeof your chosen technology. Who is doing what, howand why? What software/hardware is currentlyavailable and what are the strengths andweaknesses of competing products. Whatdevelopments are just around the corner? How hastechnology changed your chosen area of researchand the people who work within it? You arerequired to predict where your chosen technologymay be going, be able to suggest new andinnovative ways that your technology couldpotentially be used, and design a prototype todemonstrate your concept.</p>
