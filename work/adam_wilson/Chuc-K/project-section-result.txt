<p>The Chuc-K online magazine was a success since it displayed the information that I wanted to be shown. The hidden gems of the North East and the photography features of the latest issue based in Cramlington, would give the readers what the want as well as help in enticing new users to use the site. Since this was a site aimed around photography, I have used a lot of imagery throughout. This is so the customers are not overwhelmed with text and the main theme of the site can be translated through these images.</p>
