We both conducted primary research by keeping a sleep diary for two weeks to analyse our bedtime routines. It was highlighted that social events and viewing electronics before bed were a key factors that affected our sleeping and waking times. Furthermore, we also conducted interviews on other students who said they would become stressed due to assignments last minute. This would result in late nights, or even ‘all nighters’.

Outlining a relationship between stress, sleep and productivity we stated that when you are less stressed, you sleep better which makes you more productive. We aimed to create a personal assistant that will manage your tasks effectively but accounts for any social or other personal events you may have.
