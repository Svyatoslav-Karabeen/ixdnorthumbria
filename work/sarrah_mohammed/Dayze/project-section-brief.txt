A live brief from the RSA Student Design Awards, in pairs of two, our task was to design a product, service or system to improve health an wellbeing by encouraging and/or enabling a better nights sleep.

Using our own experiences as students, with the tend of studying late at night, or even all nighters, we found a pattern that not getting enough sleep at night can effect our mental wellbeing and performance. We found that 82% of students suffer from stress and anxiety and 45% of students have suffered from depression.
