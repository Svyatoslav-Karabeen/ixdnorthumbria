I researched into brain development in infants and discovered that they go through 10 ‘mental leaps’ between 4 weeks and 75 weeks. I also spoke to a child psychologist where her main research interests is cognitive development of young children’s scientific understanding. She explained to me that from birth within their cognitive development, children are recognising patterns of regularity. For example, if you said to someone “If you happy and you know it”… you know the next part of that rhyme is “clap your hands”. This constant circle outlined as ‘cause and effect’ theory is what children begin to establish.

Further research I conducted was holding a focus group interviewing mummies part of a NCT (National Childbirth Trust) group. They gave me valuable insights for buying toys for their little ones. In summary, any toy with noise and colours will keep a child engaged. We are also in a digital era where we cannot hide from tablet or smartphone technology, so possibly embracing it could fit nicely into that market.

I observed that every child will develop their cognitive development at their own pace. I have a different approach to this project as I am not forced to solve a problem. It would be nice to create a toy that bring the old and new together. Old being traditional wooden toys and new being the smartphone or tablet technology.

My initial concepts varied from putting puzzle pieces together which completes a rhyme to using voice recognition to tell a story. I decided to choose a concept where using patterns and colours of animals tells a story, linking back to cause and effect theory.
