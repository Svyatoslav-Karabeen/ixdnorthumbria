 * =============================== READ ME FIRST ===============================
 *
 * There are only a few things to fill, all of them are very straightforward I
 * hope. They are divided into three section – general info, representation and
 * information for a potential employer.
 *
 * Please fill it out carefully, do not remove any characters such as variable
 * names, inverted commas, semicolons or anything else which not in uppercase
 * orstarts with "REPLACE".
 *
 * EVERYTHING should be filled in lowercase UNLESS it's your, city or country
 * name. LEAVE BLANK means to delete a place holder and leave only = '';
 *
 * In case of any questions just drop me a message on facebook. Thank you.

 *                needed. Place stick to 'male' or 'female' only!
 *
 * $title       – how would you like to be referred (UX/UI Designer, Interaction
 *                Designer, Visual Designer etc.)

 *
 * $bioShort    – short bio somewhere between 120 and 160 characters long. Will
 *                be used for a hover effect on 'all students' page. The primary
 *                role is to make a user (employer) visit your profile
 *
 * $bioFull     – full bio somewhere between 320 and 400 characters long. Will

 *                (employer) want to hire you.
 *
 * $links       – despite there are field for all kinds of links you may
 *                have, it's not necessary to fill all of them. In fact, I'd
 *                recommend not to give a link to any empty or unrelated to
 *                professional practice profiles (e.g. Facebook) unless to are
 *                certain and doing this on purpose.
 *
 *                If you don't have a profile on some website, just delete
 *                placeholder and leave the field blank
